1
00:00:02,024 --> 00:00:03,440
In this section,
we'll be covering

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,690
the logic in our routes and
building out our app further.

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:11,940
Remember the $http service
from the first Angular course?

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,270
This is a service
that can be used

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,300
to get or put, grab
data, manipulate

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,870
data, from an outside source.

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,620
$http has a get, post, put,
and delete method, which we'll

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,560
be using in our application.

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,980
It also gives us the ability
to pass in an object.

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,820
For instance, when
you're creating data.

11
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,220
Back into our routes.

12
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,540
Not only can routes have
templates associated with them,

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,150
but we can also
have controllers.

14
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,470
So for instance, when the /notes
request comes in, we can say,

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,730
"Listen to this controller
and load in this template."

16
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:53,895
The same thing with users.

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,240
There are two ways to link
a controller to a route.

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,170
The first is inline.

19
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,260
So back into our routes file
inside of the notes route,

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,280
we're going to
define a controller

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,900
and put the function right here.

22
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,860
That can get a bit
lengthy, though.

23
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,880
If we look back at
our application tree,

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,750
you can see we've
already set aside

25
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,240
different files for
each controller.

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,060
Inside the notes
index controller

27
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,270
let's go ahead and re-declare
our Angular module.

28
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,735
And then we can declare
our notes index controller.

29
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:36,720
Now back inside routes.js
in our notes route,

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,620
we'll specify this
notes index controller

31
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,120
and we'll also give it an
alias with controllerAs.

32
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,140
Back inside our notes
index controller,

33
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,740
we're going to use
the $http get method

34
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,480
in order to actually
grab some note data.

35
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,550
So here we'll say $http,
specify the get method,

36
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,460
and give it the URL
where it's going

37
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,240
to go and grab the data from.

38
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,680
If this $http call is successful,
we'll assign the returned data

39
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,380
to this.notes.

40
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,110
Now our template will have
access to this list of notes

41
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,330
and we can use ng-repeat
to loop through them.

42
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,007
We'll say ng-repeat equals
note in our alias index

43
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:21,923
indexController.notes.

44
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,730
For each note, we're going to
display its title and icon.

45
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,190
All of this markup
should look familiar.

46
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,050
Back in the browser, we
see that all of the notes

47
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:40,700
are loaded dynamically and their
icons and titles are displayed.

48
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,370
What if we wanted
to click on a note

49
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,250
and be able to view more
information about that note

50
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,760
like you see here?

51
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,480
How could we accomplish this?

52
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,410
So let's walk through the logic
of what we want to happen.

53
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,310
First, the note is clicked.

54
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:01,160
Next, the route changes
to /notes/ the note id.

55
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,300
And then lastly, the route loads
in the view with that note's

56
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,480
information.

57
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,250
In order to accomplish
this, first we'll

58
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,860
give each note anchor an ng-href
that will plug in the note id

59
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,050
to the path.

60
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,150
Then in our routes, let's
define our notes id route.

61
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,120
We'll say .when
/notes/:id.

62
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,550
The :id is specifying
that a route parameter is here.

63
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,670
After that, we'll pass
in the template URL

64
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,900
and controller for notes
show and give that controller

65
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,330
an alias.

66
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,220
You might be
wondering, though, how

67
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,340
do we get that id
out of the route?

68
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,520
Dun dun dun.

69
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,790
Route parameters.

70
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,980
You can use route
params in order

71
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,210
to grab that note
id out of the URL.

72
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,780
So back inside our
notes show controller,

73
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,020
we can pass in $routeParams
into our function

74
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,690
and then we can create
a get method and append

75
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,400
that $routeParams.id
at the end of it

76
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,830
to fetch the data
for that single note.

77
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,290
As you can see, we're attaching
this to var controller

78
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,700
outside the success callback.

79
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,740
Then, inside the success,
we're saying controller.note

80
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,790
and setting it equal to data.

81
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,930
This keyword inside the
callback no longer references

82
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,390
the controller, so we
have to do it this way.

83
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,070
Lastly, we'll create
our notes show

84
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,950
template that will display
the information for that one

85
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,750
single note.

86
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,470
As you can see in our application,

87
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,280
each individual note now displays a note show page

88
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,250
when you click them.

89
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,680
Let's go ahead and flesh
out one last controller.

90
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,440
We'll do the notes
create controller.

91
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,240
If you think about
it, our notes create

92
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,550
controller is going to need
a method that our form can

93
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,990
call to save a new note.

94
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,310
Inside our note
create controller,

95
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,170
we're going to attach
a saveNote function.

96
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,760
Inside that function's
parameters, we'll pass it note.

97
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,360
That note is the
note data that we're

98
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,570
getting sent from our form.

99
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,900
Then we'll make an $http
call with a method of post,

100
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,790
give it the URL that
we're sending our data to,

101
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,520
and lastly the note
object, which contains all

102
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,770
of the new note's information.

103
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,360
What if our $http call fails?

104
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,570
We need to be able to give
this feedback to our user.

105
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:36,540
So let's go ahead and create a
this.errors variable and set

106
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,750
it equal to null.

107
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,130
Currently there are no errors.

108
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,700
Then we'll declare the catch
callback, which will only

109
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,520
be called if there's an error.

110
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,160
And we'll assign that error to
the variable we just created,

111
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,510
this.errors.

112
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,970
If you wanted to display
this in our template,

113
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:55,780
we could use an ng-if there's an error, then go ahead

114
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,180
and display that error.

115
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:03,380
You might have noticed that
we're making calls to a server

116
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,116
to get or post data.

117
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:06,490
We're not going
to talk about how

118
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,560
to configure a back end in this
course, but you're in luck.

119
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,910
Code School has a
ton of courses that

120
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,080
cover that, all the
way from Ruby on Rails

121
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,470
to an Express course
that just came out.

122
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,880
This concludes Level 1.

123
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,920
Good luck on those challenges.

124
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,830
Wrangler app.

125
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,640
Wrangler.

126
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,540
Users in our note wrangular app.

127
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,660
Wrangler.

128
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,300
Our note wrangular app.
