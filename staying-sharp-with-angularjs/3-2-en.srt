1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:02,826
Hello.

2
00:00:02,826 --> 00:00:04,825
In this section, we're
covering another factory.

3
00:00:07,354 --> 00:00:09,770
The next feature we want to
implement in our Note Wrangler

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,970
app is having a glamorous
photo for each of our users.

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,120
Maybe a puppy, too, but
we'll get to that later.

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,180
A solution to this is to
use the Gravatar service.

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,710
Gravatar is a very helpful web
app that allows people like me

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,440
or you to upload
images associated

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,950
with an email address.

10
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,450
Then we can use,
in our application,

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,695
that email address
to grab those photos.

12
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,430
In order to use someone's
Gravatar in our application,

13
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,130
there are three steps.

14
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,950
First, you need to hash
their email address.

15
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,910
Then, you append their
hashed email address

16
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,500
to a Gravatar URL.

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,880
Lastly, use this
URL in the template

18
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,280
with an ng-src attribute.

19
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,770
Hold on.

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,390
This sounds like
shared functionality

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,790
across our application,
which makes

22
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,760
me think it's service time.

23
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,060
Let's create a service
for this that we can then

24
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,260
use in the controllers
and then in the templates.

25
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,220
[SINGING] We need a Gravatar.

26
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,720
Make a service.

27
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,380
We need a Gravatar.

28
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,230
Fade out to black.

29
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,880
So as expected, in our
services directory,

30
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,840
we'll create a gravatar.js file.

31
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,670
And then we'll use the factory
recipe to define our service.

32
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,541
We'll name it Gravatar, and
then the function, of course,

33
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:34,790
will be named GravatarFactory.

34
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,340
Before we create the
meat of this factory,

35
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,650
we're going to need some
reusable variables that we can

36
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,970
define outside of the return.

37
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,200
We'll say var
avatarSize = 80,

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,970
which is setting a default
size for our avatar images.

39
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,720
This avatar size variable
will be used later

40
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,370
in the URL, which will return
us different sizes of the image

41
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,580
we're requesting.

42
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,900
So as you see here,
if we say size 100,

43
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,039
it'll give us an
itty-bitty picture,

44
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,520
whereas if we say
size 500, it'll

45
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,920
give us a massive picture.

46
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,350
Along with a default avatar
size to append to the link,

47
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,060
we'll need a reusable link
variable for the Gravatar size.

48
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,930
So we'll say var avatarURL
and we'll give it the default,

49
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,540
http://gravatar.com/avatar/.

50
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,069
That will be used
at the beginning

51
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:31,985
of each of these URLs.

52
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,890
Now we need to go back
to these three steps

53
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,700
and make some magic happen.

54
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,200
So first off, hashing the email.

55
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,070
How do we hash-ify something?

56
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,900
Well, there's a fun
thing called CryptoJS.

57
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,600
Stay with me.

58
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,000
CryptoJS is a simple
JavaScript library

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,970
that has an .MD5 function.

60
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,530
You can pass this
function a string,

61
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,650
and it will return
that string hash-ified.

62
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,480
In our index, in order to
have access to CryptoJS,

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,150
we'll need to include
this script tag.

64
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,395
The next step — we'll need to
add this hash onto our Gravatar

65
00:03:08,395 --> 00:03:08,895
URL.

66
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,170
So back into our service.

67
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,300
We'll create a generate
property with a function

68
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,830
that takes an email.

69
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:23,250
That will return an avatar
URL plus the CryptoJS

70
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,360
hash-ified email, plus the size.

71
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,250
And if you'll notice,
we have to call

72
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,830
toString on that avatar
size, because it's currently

73
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:32,400
a number.

74
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,060
Here is our beautiful and
complete Gravatar service.

75
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,240
In order to call it, we need to
first inject it and then call

76
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,495
the generate method off
of it, like you see here.

77
00:03:45,495 --> 00:03:46,860
[LAUGHS]

78
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,000
We can actually
simplify this code.

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,060
If your service only contains
one function, instead

80
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,230
of returning an object
with that one function,

81
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,160
you can just return
the function, like so.

82
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,760
And then to call the service,
you simply call Gravatar.

83
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:12,500
Inside our users index
template, our nw-card directive

84
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,640
now needs an image attribute.

85
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,190
We'll set that image attribute
to call the gravatarUrl method

86
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,050
we just made.

87
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,300
To make this work,
we obviously need

88
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,750
to go back into the
directive and configure

89
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,490
image in the scope.

90
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,490
We'll two-way bind it
with the = character.

91
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,760
Now we can go back into
the nw-card template

92
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,220
and use ng-src to display
the Gravatar image.

93
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,120
And all of our users
have glamorous photos.

94
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,110
Let's go through the five
different service recipes,

95
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,330
just so you're aware of
them as you're building out

96
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,270
Angular apps on your own.

97
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,250
First there's Value,
which is used often.

98
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,880
It's the simplest
service recipe,

99
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,740
and it's used for sharing just
a value throughout your app

100
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,079
repeatedly.

101
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,370
Then there's Factory, which
is used for sharing methods

102
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,300
and objects, like we
learned previously.

103
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,000
Next there's Service.

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,650
Yes, it is a Service
service recipe.

105
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,650
It's used for sharing instances
of methods and objects,

106
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,400
instead of the actual
method or object.

107
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,240
The fourth recipe is Provider.

108
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,980
It's used for sharing methods
and objects like a factory

109
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,220
but allows for configuration.

110
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,220
The last recipe is Constant.

111
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,720
It's used for sharing a
value within an application

112
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,570
configuration.

113
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,290
No worries.

114
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,410
There won't be a pop
quiz on all five recipes.

115
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,370
Just go practice
using Factory again,

116
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,380
and I'll see you back
in the third section.
