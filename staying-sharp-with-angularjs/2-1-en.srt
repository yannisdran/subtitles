00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,980
[SINGING] 4:30 in the morning,
coding front-end on your site.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,140
Console errors warning —
you don't know how to fight.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,030
Reusable and flexible
directives are what you need.

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,453
Link and scope are sensible
in reliant apps with speed.

5
00:00:14,453 --> 00:00:17,974
Services will be okay
to craft your own Note Wrangler.

6
00:00:17,974 --> 00:00:21,255
You are on your way to
Staying Sharp with Angular.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,690
You're watching Staying
Sharp with Angular.js.

8
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,410
And my name is Alyssa Nicoll.

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,320
This is Level 2.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,540
And we'll be jumping into
more advanced directives

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,320
and talking about
$scope in this section.

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,290
Here's our application
where we last left it.

13
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,710
If we jump into
our notes.html, you

14
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,230
can see that each time
we create a note card,

15
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,440
we're reusing the same
chunk over and over again.

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,450
Well, as you learned in
the last Angular course,

17
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,300
we can just take this
duplicated HTML out

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,840
and put it into a
template-expanding directive.

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,740
We're calling this
directive nw-card.

20
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,426
The nw, of course, stands
for "note wrangler,"

21
00:01:03,426 --> 00:01:04,675
the prefix of our application.

22
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,900
So here in our
notes.html, you can

23
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,790
see we're using this
new directive we just

24
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,510
created — nw-card.

25
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,990
And then we'll define our nw-card directive.

26
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,880
Inside of that function, we'll return an object

27
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,090
with a restrict property set to E for "element"

28
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,720
and a template URL pointing to our HTML.

29
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,880
Say we want to set a
header on our note cards.

30
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,600
We'll go ahead and
create a controller

31
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,150
where we can do
that functionality

32
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:42,530
and give that controller an
alias with controllerAs.

33
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,210
Inside the controller,
we then can

34
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,130
say this.header
equals a string.

35
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,010
And we'll just say "Note Title" for now.

36
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,350
Then inside the template,
we can print this

37
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,020
to the screen using
an expression,

38
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,350
we'll say bracket,
bracket, card.header.

39
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,840
If you see now, we actually have "Note Title"

40
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,295
being printed on the page.

41
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,520
There's another way
we can implement

42
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,640
this using the $scope variable.

43
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,060
You've probably seen
this before in tutorials

44
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,020
or in other Angular
applications.

45
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,580
So inside the controller
function, we'll pass in $scope.

46
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,770
And then we'll attach header
to $scope instead of this.

47
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,420
Now that we're
attaching to $scope,

48
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,030
we no longer need the alias.

49
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,290
So you get rid of
the controllerAs line

50
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,360
in our directive.

51
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,445
And then inside of the HTML, you can get rid of the card alias.

52
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,285
And the directive still
works as expected.

53
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,140
Let's compare the two
syntaxes side by side.

54
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,720
This is attaching
to $scope behind the scenes.

55
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,770
Whereas with just $scope,
we're attaching it directly

56
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,520
to the controller.

57
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,885
We don't need the card alias.

58
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,720
So both syntaxes lead
to the same result.

59
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,660
We're going to use the $scope
syntax from here on out,

60
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,050
but either are fine.

61
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,070
$Scope is a large part of
Angular as a language.

62
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,870
So why don't you go
get comfortable with it

63
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,940
in a few challenges,

64
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,650
and we'll see you back
in the next section.
