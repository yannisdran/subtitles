1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,000
Are you ready for
the last section?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,230
In this one, we're talking
about external libraries.

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,460
A lot of times we use external
libraries in our applications.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,309
In an Angular app, it's best
to wrap that external library

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,800
in a directive, and then
reuse that directive

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,780
throughout your application.

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,120
So for example, look
at this tooltip.

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,170
It's kind of ugly.

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,600
We could replace this tooltip
with a prettier Bootstrap one

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,779
using directives.

11
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,570
Let's go ahead and find
out how to do that.

12
00:00:35,105 --> 00:00:36,480
First, we want to
get the library

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,550
we want to use — Bootstrap,
in this case — put it

14
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,380
in the vendor directory, and
include it in our application.

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,080
Now we're ready to
create our directive.

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,750
We're going to
name this directive

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,020
"title," without any nw prefix.

18
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,100
This is because we want to
override the default HTML title

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,990
attribute.

20
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,890
This directive is going to
be an attribute directive.

21
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,480
And all of its
functionality will

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,550
be inside the link function.

23
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,220
Directives by default
are restricted to A,

24
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,970
so we don't need
to specify that.

25
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,200
If your directive is only
returning a link function,

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,610
there's an alternative
syntax for this.

27
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,300
So instead of return object and
then specify the link function,

28
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,870
you can just return
an anonymous function.

29
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,580
Now inside of our anonymously
returned link function,

30
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,550
we can call the tooltip
method from Bootstrap.

31
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,590
So we'll say element.tooltip,
and then pass it

32
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,900
a container body.

33
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,680
We're already specifying
the title attribute

34
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,380
inside of our card.

35
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,620
So now all we have to do is
go and load in the browser,

36
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,810
and you'll see that our
tooltip is being replaced

37
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,440
with the Bootstrap tooltip.

38
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,360
However, the tooltip
isn't working.

39
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,090
It's showing up,
but it's no longer

40
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,000
interpolating the expression.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,840
It's just saying
bracket, bracket, header.

42
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,070
This is because the link
function only runs one time.

43
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,570
And when our link
function ran, Angular

44
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,280
didn't have access to
the header variable,

45
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,980
so it just set it to
bracket, bracket, header.

46
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,940
A simple but kind of
janky fix for this

47
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,500
is surrounding it by a timeout.

48
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,140
This will cause Angular to run
through an entire event loop

49
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,990
before replacing the tooltip.

50
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,080
By that time, the
header value will exist,

51
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,830
and our title directive
works as expected.

52
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,700
Our tooltip now works,
but as a best practice

53
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,980
we need to clean up
after our directive.

54
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,300
We can do this by listening
for the destroy event.

55
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,400
So we can just say
scope.on $destroy,

56
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,179
and then inside of that say
element.tooltip destroy.

57
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:03,095
This will clean up after
our directive nicely.

58
00:03:06,036 --> 00:03:08,410
You might be wondering, after
seeing all the things we've

59
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,750
done in the link
function, "When should I

60
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,390
use the controller
inside a directive?"

61
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,050
Just remember, if you
need to share something

62
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,870
between directives, do that
logic inside of a controller

63
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,990
and use the require property.

64
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,925
Otherwise, it's your best
bet to use the link function.

65
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,167
Have fun making some external
library directives of your own,

66
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:33,625
and I hope you
enjoyed this course.

We will survive.
