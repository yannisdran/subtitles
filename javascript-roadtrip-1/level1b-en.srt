1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,240
Next we have strings.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,820
Strings are JavaScript's way
of handling and storing and

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,270
processing flat text.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,670
In order to signal to JavaScript
that we want to

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,990
process some flat text, we
need to use a pair of

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,220
quotation marks surroundings
some text as we enter the

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,680
string into the console.

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,560
Here you can see two different
strings, "Raindrops On Roses"

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,120
and "Whiskers On Kittens".

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,740
When we surround the text with
quotation marks, JavaScript

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,840
recognizes it as a string and
then returns the string right

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,320
back to us.

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,550
We can also use the plus
operator uniquely with strings

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,780
in a process called
concatenation.

15
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,610
Concatenation places strings
together inside of one string

16
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,560
and returns one master
string at the end.

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,440
Here you can see "Raindrops On
Roses" concatenated with

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,290
another string that says space
and space, concatenated with

19
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,530
another string that says
"Whiskers On Kittens".

20
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,750
As a result, we get
"Raindrops On Roses

21
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,000
And Whiskers On Kittens".

22
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,530
Now, it's time for a few
of my favorite … strings.

23
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,570
Concatenation will also work
with numbers and their

24
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,530
expressions, too.

25
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,770
In this first example, we can
see that when we try to

26
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,740
concatenate "The meaning of life
is" with the value "42", we

27
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,410
get a perfectly valid string
at the end, but it's not

28
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,300
formatted exactly like
we would want.

29
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,880
It seems to be that we're
missing a space.

30
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,400
Since concatenation does not
provide a space for you, all

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,200
we need to do to fix this is
place a space inside the very

32
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,450
first string.

33
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,190
We can also concatenate
expressions into strings.

34
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:49,100
However, expressions will get
evaluated by the console.

35
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,830
As you see here with 0.75,
3/4 got evaluated.

36
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,320
In order to fix that, we
actually need to place the

37
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,030
expression inside of the string
so we get the flat text

38
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,580
of "3/4" instead of 0.75.

39
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,160
When working with strings,
you'll need some special

40
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,370
characters to achieve some
specific formatting.

41
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,220
Here in this example, you can
see a  \t, which

42
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,010
represents an advancement
to the next tab stop.

43
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,520
Here, in the output, you can
see that the \t's

44
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,810
have disappeared, and in their
place is an advancement to the

45
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,750
next tab stop inside
the string?

46
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,670
What if we needed double
quotation marks

47
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,980
inside of our string.

48
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,250
Well, the console looks at
double quotation marks as

49
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,910
beginning or ending a string.

50
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,740
So we need a special way of
escaping that double quotation

51
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,190
mark, and so we use a backslash
before quotation

52
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,320
mark in that case as well.

53
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,370
In our output result, we can
see that we have a set of

54
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,380
double quotation marks
inside the string.

55
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,660
What if we want a backslash
inside of a string?

56
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,280
Well, since it's a special
character, we need to use a

57
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,450
double backslash to produce just
one backslash inside of

58
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,770
the string.

59
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,550
Following that, we have
a \ n that

60
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,670
represents a new line.

61
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,940
You can see in the output here,
that the string is split

62
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,820
up across multiple lines because
of the 
.

63
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,470
This is by no means an
exhaustive compilation of

64
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,350
special characters for use in
string formatting, and you can

65
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,770
research the rest
on the internet.

66
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,560
Sometimes we'd like to compare
strings for alphabetical

67
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,820
ordering or for matching
strings.

68
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,060
JavaScript allows us to compare
strings with specific

69
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,640
comparators.

70
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,160
We can use the double equal
sign to compare "The Wright

71
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,200
Brothers" with "The Wright
Brothers", which returns a

72
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,210
truth value because those
strings are exactly the same.

73
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,250
We can see that if we use double
equal on "The Wright

74
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,760
Brothers" and "Super Mario
Brothers", that we would get a

75
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,530
false value, because
those strings are

76
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,320
not at all the same.

77
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,760
Now, here's a tricky one.

78
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,520
If we see "The Wright Brothers"
compared with "the wright

79
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,670
brothers" in a not equal
situation, this will return a

80
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,530
truth value.

81
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,470
The reason that is is because
those strings are not exactly

82
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,350
the same because JavaScript
is case sensitive

83
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,810
with regard to strings.

84
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,060
So, they are not equal.

85
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,120
We can also access the length
of strings using the .

86
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,540
length property.

87
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,570
You can see here that if we
have a super long English

88
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,450
word,
"antidisestablishmentarianism",

89
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,030
and we use the  .length
property, that the JavaScript

90
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:36,540
console would return a very
nice value to us of 28.

91
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,460
And again, when we used "One
Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue

92
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,130
Fish", if we used the .length
property on that,

93
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,690
JavaScript will return a 39.

94
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,830
Now, what's really important
here is that the .length

95
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,130
property will calculate all of
the spaces and all of the

96
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,340
punctuation in determining
your length.

97
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,820
Now, it's time for you to use
your brand new JavaScript

98
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,730
skills in the challenges
section.

99
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,000
We'll see you in the next one.

100
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,320
Backslash.

101
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,220
Multiple, multiple special
characters for use for string

102
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:11,550
formatting.

103
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,990
I don't know why you're saying that word twice
