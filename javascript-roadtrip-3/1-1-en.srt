1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,080
Hey code-school friends.

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,640
Welcome to the third edition
of the JavaScript Road Trip.

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,400
As you know by now, JavaScript
is a very powerful web

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,450
scripting language used
all over the world,

6
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,781
in innumerable
web-based applications.

7
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:16,239
And a knowledge of it is going
to be an extraordinary asset

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,960
to you on your journey
as a developer.

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,560
Now, if JavaScript is
still sort of new to you,

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,290
you probably want to go hang
with road trips one and two,

11
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,020
because we'll definitely be
taking several, if not all

12
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,640
of those concepts
and layering them

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,780
into the topics of this course.

14
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,760
As far as new stuff,
we'll be examining

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,470
the fine art of the
function expression

16
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,110
as well as the cool and often
mind-boggling use of closures

17
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,950
and then the impact of
hoisting on load order.

18
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,950
Ultimately, we'll wrap up with
an introductory exploration

19
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,710
of the awesomely important
JavaScript object

20
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,980
and then examine
their blueprints

21
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,570
in the form of constructors
and prototypes.

22
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,770
So with that, let's start
the JavaScript Road Trip,

23
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:58,490
Part Three.

24
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,390
[SINGING] From the Labyrinth of
Loops to the Variable Valley,

25
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,120
we'll see the Cliffs
of Value first.

26
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,660
JavaScript's right up your all.

27
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,990
Built-in's Bluff, Files
Falls, Array Archipelago,

28
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,800
declarations in a
desert, where you'll

29
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,925
find out how far you'll go.

30
00:01:11,925 --> 00:01:13,810
Learn the program, take a ride.

31
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,265
Buy a ticket, step inside.

32
00:01:15,265 --> 00:01:17,214
All aboard, you're
at the station

33
00:01:17,214 --> 00:01:19,740
to increase your education
Bon Voyage and skinny dip,

34
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,660
as long as functions
you don't skip

35
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,190
on this, the
JavaScript Road Trip.

36
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,030

37
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,060
To start off this
leg of the road trip,

38
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,430
we'll be examining a
special usage of a function

39
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,252
inside of JavaScript called
the function expression.

40
00:01:37,252 --> 00:01:38,710
Periodically, when
we code, we need

41
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,280
to make an efficient
choice about which

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,980
function to actually build
when our program loads.

43
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,840
Typically, we do this
when we've received

44
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,400
a special piece
of data or when we

45
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,170
need to build a one-time,
one-run function

46
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,900
for our websites.

47
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,980
Also, we want to make
sure that we do this

48
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,390
without building every
possible function that we could

49
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,880
when our program loads in order
to conserve program memory.

50
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,250
Additionally, we often want to
take functions and pass them

51
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,780
to other functions.

52
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,780
Or we may want to immediately
call the function as soon

53
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,150
as it's built.

54
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,310
And with that, we hope
you enjoy traversing

55
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,600
the forest of
function expressions.

56
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,920

57
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,370
So here we in level one.

58
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,430
Welcome back to JavaScript
Road Trip Three.

59
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,520
So in this level,
the first level,

60
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,900
we'll be looking at function
expressions-- pretty cool

61
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,270
thing, which we like to
call functions on the fly.

62
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,887
Now, in order to understand
what a function expression is,

63
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:39,220
we'll first need to look at
what you already understand,

64
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,280
which is a declared function.

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,000
Check this one out right here.

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,900
You can see here,
on this first block,

67
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,160
a declared function
called diffOfSquares.

68
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,450
Now, we've given it
two inputs-- a and b.

69
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,340
And you can see
that we've square a

70
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,764
and squared b and
then subtracted

71
00:02:55,764 --> 00:02:57,430
them-- see the minus
sign in the middle.

72
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,790
And then that's the value
that we are returning.

73
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,160
So there's our
declared function.

74
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,690
This function,
since it's declared,

75
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,530
is actually loaded right
when the program is run.

76
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,460
And it is loaded into
memory and held there

77
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,490
until you want to use it.

78
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,520
Function expressions
apply things a little bit

79
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,482
differently.

80
00:03:16,482 --> 00:03:17,940
So the first thing
that we would do

81
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,930
is we would
establish a variable.

82
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,970
Let's call it diff.

83
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,060
And then what we would
do is we would rearrange

84
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,980
the declared function into
an assignment statement.

85
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,690
And this particular thing is
called a function expression.

86
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:37,050
And it loads only when this
particular line of code

87
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,570
is reached inside your program.

88
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,200
So take a look, you can
see the function key word.

89
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,980
Then you can see the
diffOfSquares, function name,

90
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,610
and the inputs all in
the same place, and then

91
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,860
the very same function body
that does the same stuff that we

92
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,690
had in our declared function.

93
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,790
Again, this loads
only when your program

94
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,139
reaches that line of code.

95
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,680
Another thing you
should take note of

96
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,330
is that since this is now
an assignment statement,

97
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,670
meaning we're taking
this entire function

98
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,900
and assigning it
the variable diff,

99
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,100
we need a semicolon
here, on the end

100
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,020
of our final bracket
of our function body.

101
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,019
Now, in order to call our
cool new variable diff,

102
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:20,231
we're actually going to
use the variable's name.

103
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:21,730
That's right, it's
going to be diff.

104
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,330
We're not going to use the
diffOfSquares name that's

105
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,730
inside the function.

106
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,980
Then we just pass
two parameters to it.

107
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,140
We're just going
to give it 9 and 5.

108
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,060
And you can see that
that returns 56,

109
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,790
because you get 81
minus 25 returns 56.

110
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,810
Something to check
out here is that I

111
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,080
have given parameter parenthesis
to the variable diff.

112
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,750
We haven't seen
that before, right?

113
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,890
And then we pass parameters
into those parentheses

114
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,470
that we've given to diff.

115
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,660
And we need those in order
to actually call the function

116
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,360
and give it some parameters.

117
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,250
Now, you might be
wondering, why in the heck

118
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,340
do we still have that
diffOfSquares name if we're

119
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,926
just going to use the
diff variable name?

120
00:05:02,926 --> 00:05:04,050
It's an excellent question.

121
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:04,860
And guess what?

122
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,490
We don't.

123
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,750
So let's take a look at that.

124
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,100
There's this cool
thing in JavaScript,

125
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,390
and in other languages,
called the anonymous function.

126
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,320
It means that you can
build a function expression

127
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,550
without a name, because
it's being assigned

128
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,450
to a variable that will
hold the entire contents

129
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,110
of that function.

130
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,404
So since we don't need
that diffOfSquares name,

131
00:05:27,404 --> 00:05:28,820
we can go ahead
and get rid of it.

132
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,653
Let's get rid of it.

133
00:05:29,653 --> 00:05:30,460
There it goes.

134
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,760
And now we will just scoot the
parameters and the first body

135
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,090
bracket up against
the function keyword,

136
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,950
and we have an anonymous
function, particularly

137
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,525
an anonymous
function expression.

138
00:05:43,525 --> 00:05:44,150
Now guess what?

139
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,270
Just because it's anonymous
doesn't mean anything.

140
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,860
We still call the function
with our new variable name.

141
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,260
And we pass in some
parameters, 4 and 2.

142
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,200
That would give us 16 and 4.

143
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,185
And when we subtract
those, we get 12.

144
00:05:56,185 --> 00:06:00,544

145
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:02,210
Now, in our previous
JavaScript courses,

146
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,610
we've been logging
out tons of variables

147
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,710
to see what they hold, to
see what their contents are.

148
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,560
What might happen if we did
that with our new diff variable

149
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,050
that holds a function?

150
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,480
Well, as you might expect, you
will get the actual function

151
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,830
body returned as a result,
so that you can always

152
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,250
check the contents of
a variable to see what

153
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,880
function it is
actually referring to.

154
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,370

155
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,840
Let's take a look and see how
we can use function expressions,

156
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,290
stored functions in a
national park terminal,

157
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:41,390
specifically at the forest
of function expressions.

158
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,180
One of the cool things about
variables that hold functions

159
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,780
is that they can be passed
into other functions for use

160
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,110
inside that function.

161
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,830
Well, let's take a look at that.

162
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,700
So say we had a JavaScript file.

163
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,680
We'll call it terminal.js for
the national park terminal.

164
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,480
And we wanted to build
a greeting for people

165
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,110
that were attending, let's say,
the Badlands National Park.

166
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,150
So here, you can see
we have established

167
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,950
a variable called greeting.

168
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,140
And in that particular
variable, we

169
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,140
are going to store a
function expression that

170
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,070
will alert a
message to the user.

171
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,580
"Thanks for visiting
the Badlands.

172
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,730
We hope you stay is
better than most."

173
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,610
Next, near the end
of our file, we

174
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,630
will establish a declared
function called closeTerminal.

175
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,810
And what that will get past
is a function expression.

176
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,110
The parameter name for
it will be message.

177
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:35,510
And then inside closeTerminal,
that function will be called.

178
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,150
So maybe you can
kind of see how we

179
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,820
will use the greeting
variable coming up.

180
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,300
Later on in our file, after
our customer has perhaps

181
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,050
interacted in some other
ways with the terminal,

182
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,135
the closeTerminal
function will be called.

183
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:48,510
And you can see
that we've passed

184
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,060
greeting into closeTerminal.

185
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,820
So let's take a
look at what happens

186
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,730
when we pass greeting
to closeTerminal.

187
00:07:55,730 --> 00:08:00,520
Well, the message parameter
becomes the greeting variable.

188
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,480
And then inside
closeTerminal, the function

189
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,860
that's in greeting gets called.

190
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,120
Then we would get
the alert message.

191
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,570
"Thanks for visiting
the Badlands.

192
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:14,259
We hope your stay is
better than most."

193
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:15,550
So one greeting is pretty cool.

194
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,237
But what if we had
multiple greetings?

195
00:08:18,237 --> 00:08:19,820
We could have multiple
different kinds

196
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,460
of greetings for different
kinds of customers.

197
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,136
Function expressions are
very cool and very useful

198
00:08:25,136 --> 00:08:26,510
in this way,
because they give us

199
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:30,930
a flexibility in determining
exactly which functionality we

200
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,289
want to store and
then pass in later.

201
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,139
So let's go ahead and
scoot our stuff down.

202
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:37,990
[INAUDIBLE]

203
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,419
And now we are going to try
to build multiple greetings.

204
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:43,380
So we'll establish
our greeting variable,

205
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,755
but we're not going to assign
a function expression to it

206
00:08:45,755 --> 00:08:48,270
quite yet, because we need
to decide whether we have

207
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,270
a new customer or
an old customer.

208
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,020
So we've got some
code that'll be

209
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,510
there in our
terminal.js file that

210
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,100
will decide whether
we have a new customer

211
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,970
or an old customer, and
therefore new customer will be

212
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,470
true or false by the time
we reach this conditional.

213
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,840
If we have a new
customer, then we'll

214
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,760
go ahead and assign
our previous message

215
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,110
that we built to the
greeting variable.

216
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,720
But otherwise, meaning
it's not a new customer,

217
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,090
then we'll make a
different function.

218
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,290
And we'll say, "Welcome
back to the Badlands.

219
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,030
Guess they aren't so bad, huh?"

220
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,760
So that's for our old
customers-- people

221
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,850
that have been to
the Badlands before.

222
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,130
So now you can
notice that we have

223
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,490
two possible greetings
with one variable.

224
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,220
Let's see what we
can do with that.

225
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,450
So now, if new
customer somehow was

226
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,140
set to false by our
terminal, we know

227
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,690
that when we would pass
the greeting variable

228
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,410
into closeTerminal, we would
get the old customer message.

229
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,660
"Welcome back to the Badlands.

230
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,250
Guess they aren't so bad."

231
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,350
And then if we were to also
change new customer to true,

232
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,700
we can see the
message that comes up

233
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,520
is exactly the old one
that we had built before.

234
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,420

235
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,350
So that's a brief introduction
to function expressions.

236
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,270
And we will release
you to the challenges.

237
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,390
I hope your stay is
better than most.

238
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,800
