1
00:00:00,196 --> 00:00:01,820
[SINGING] The
Flatlanders need to store

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,790
to sell their gems and more -
and they need it really quick.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,510
Angular will do the trick.

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,460
Directives set the
stage in your HTML page.

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,310
Controllers give your wrap
the behavior that it lacks.

6
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,525
Write expressions so that
you can add your data

7
00:00:14,525 --> 00:00:16,800
to the view. And modules
make connections

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,320
with dependency injections.

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,780
You're a scripting
connoisseur when

10
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,870
shaping up with Angular JS.

11
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,270
Welcome to Shaping
Up With Angular.

12
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,862
I'm Gregg Pollack,
and in Level One

13
00:00:31,862 --> 00:00:33,320
we'll be giving
you an introduction

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,860
to what is Angular. We'll
show you the application we'll

15
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,620
be building together
in this course,

16
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,770
and then introducing you to the
core elements of any Angular

17
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,240
application.

18
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,090
In order to learn
Angular, it's important

19
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,070
that you're very familiar
with HTML and CSS,

20
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,896
as well as JavaScript.

21
00:00:49,896 --> 00:00:51,520
If you're not familiar
with JavaScript,

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,200
Code School's got a great
course JavaScript Road

23
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,590
Trip, which you
should go check out.

24
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,510
It's also nice if you
know some testing tools.

25
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,500
Behavior Driven Development,
Test-Driven Development,

26
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,250
because Angular is
really easy to test.

27
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,770
And you should be doing that
in a professional application.

28
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,460
Not so important, you
don't need to know jQuery,

29
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,060
Ruby on Rails, Python, PHP,
or any of those back end

30
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,230
frameworks.

31
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,040
Angular is just a
front end framework,

32
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,220
so all you need to
know is JavaScript.

33
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,570
You may want to use Angular
when you're using JavaScript

34
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,600
to build any sort
of dynamic website.

35
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,170
Angular is going to help you
organize your JavaScript code.

36
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,900
It's going to help you
create responsive websites,

37
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,450
meaning they're fast, they
respond quickly to user input.

38
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,000
Also, if you're
familiar with jQuery,

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,600
Angular plays really
well with jQuery.

40
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,590
And it's also, as
I mentioned before,

41
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,730
really easy to test,
which means you

42
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,220
can create
maintainable software.

43
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,110
Let's dive a little
deeper into this word

44
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,720
"responsive" and see what I mean.

45
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,470
So here's the Code
School website.

46
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,720
And you'll see that when I click
on a link like, screencasts,

47
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,150
the page goes blank for second,
and then reloads that page.

48
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,740
And then I click
on something else,

49
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,280
and it goes, and it processes,
and brings up something,

50
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,009
and I get to see that page.

51
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:14,600
This is a traditional page
refresh response cycle,

52
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,060
but what's going on
behind the curtains?

53
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,040
So here we have our
browser and our web server.

54
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,740
And our browser's going
to initiate a request

55
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,770
to our server.

56
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,670
The server responds with the
web pages and assets, the HTML

57
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,310
and JavaScript, and our browser
loads of the entire web page.

58
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,070
But when the user
clicks on a link,

59
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,250
initiates a new
request, and the server

60
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,180
responds with a new
web page and assets,

61
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,960
the browser to load up
the entire web page again.

62
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:49,050
Obviously, laid out like this,
it's not quite efficient.

63
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,340
So now here's an
example of a web page

64
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,260
I would call responsive.

65
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,210
This is our recent
Discover Drive course.

66
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:00,180
You'll see when I
click around this page,

67
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,580
the page refresh is
almost unnoticeable.

68
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,950
The pages so responsive
and quick every time

69
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,170
we click on a link.

70
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,360
So what's going on here?

71
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,510
Well, behind the curtains when
a request is first fired off,

72
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,300
the server responds back with
all the web page and assets,

73
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,800
as you might expect,
and the browser

74
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,350
loads up the entire webpage.

75
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,200
This time, when a
user clicks a link,

76
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,450
something different
is going to happen.

77
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,370
It's only going to
request the information

78
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,210
it needs to update the page.

79
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,300
In this case, just
some JSON data.

80
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,170
Once our browser
has this data, it's

81
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,500
going to load it into
the existing page,

82
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,180
and update what we
see on our browser.

83
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,840
An increasing number
of applications

84
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,730
these days are building
their own APIs.

85
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,480
They might do this to interface
with a mobile application,

86
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,270
say on iOS.

87
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,300
They might also build an API so
that other developers can build

88
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,970
applications that communicate
with their application.

89
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,500
They might also built APIs
to communicate with front-end

90
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,920
applications, like
the application we're

91
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,760
building in this
course using Angular.

92
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,190
So in this course, we'll
be building a front-end

93
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,470
application using Angular,
which will communicate

94
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,279
with a back-end application.

95
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,279
But we're not going to
be building that back-end

96
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:21,890
application, we're just going
to focus on the front-end.

97
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,310
A simple definition of Angular
is a client-side JavaScript

98
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,490
framework for adding
interactivity to HTML.

99
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,960
We need to figure out
how to tell our HTML when

100
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,870
to trigger our JavaScript.

101
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,450
So here we have some
HTML, how might we

102
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,780
tell it to call this function,
which triggers an alert?

103
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,220
In Angular we add behavior to
our HTML through directives.

104
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,090
A directive as a marker
on an HTML tag that tells

105
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,010
angular to run or reference
some JavaScript code.

106
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,860
So the answer here is to add
the attribute ng-controller

107
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,680
to our body tag, setting
it equal to "StoreController"

108
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,810
which is the name
of our function.

109
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:07,000
And if we loaded this up,
we might get this alert.

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,290
Obviously, this is a
really contrived example,

111
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,450
and you would never actually
write this Angular code,

112
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,990
but you get the gist of it.

113
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,200
Directives, it's how
we bind the behavior.

114
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,870
The application
we'll be building

115
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,680
in the rest of this course
is our Flatlander's store.

116
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,590
In it you can see we
have several thumbnails

117
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,820
of different products.

118
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,640
We can tab through different
information about each of them

119
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,490
and we have reviews.

120
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,310
You'll see a list of
reviews and we'll even

121
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,754
be able to submit our own
review using this form here.

122
00:05:39,754 --> 00:05:42,170
The first step, if you want
to start playing with Angular,

123
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:46,240
is to download the library
from the official website.

124
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,750
In the application we'll
be building in this course,

125
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,380
we're going to be using Twitter
Bootstrap, which you also

126
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,360
might want to download, and
feel free to follow along.

127
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,470
Let's start coding up our HTML.

128
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,130
You can see here we've included
the CSS for Twitter Bootstrap

129
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,220
and we've included the
angular library, which

130
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,300
we downloaded as well.

131
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,340
The next component of
our Angular application

132
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,610
that we need to learn
about is modules.

133
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,810
Modules are where
we write pieces

134
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,710
of our Angular application.

135
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,510
It's how we keep our
code encapsulated.

136
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,540
Because of this, it makes
our code more maintainable,

137
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,820
more readable,
and more testable.

138
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,860
Also, it's where we define
all of the dependencies

139
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,400
for our application.

140
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,620
Because we might run one
module and we can tell our code

141
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,180
this module depends
on these two modules.

142
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,830
So it shouldn't surprise you
that the very piece of code

143
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,860
that you write in
Angular is a module line.

144
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,520
So we're going to right var
app - that's our application -

145
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,430
equals angular - that's the
AngularJS library - dot module -

146
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,260
because we're
creating a new module.

147
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,280
We give it a name -

148
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,150
In this case, "store."

149
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,360
And then, in that little arrays
syntax, we define dependencies.

150
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,410
We don't have any
dependencies yet,

151
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,930
but we still have to
send in an empty array.

152
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:11,530
Because that's how we roll.

153
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,970
This piece of code is going
to live inside an app.js file.

154
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,340
So we're going to need to
include that in our HTML,

155
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,010
as you can see right here.

156
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:24,802
Then we'll need to add an
attribute to our HTML tag.

157
00:07:24,802 --> 00:07:26,010
In this case, ng-app equals "store."

158
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,480
ng-app, remember, is
another directive.

159
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,410
This directive creates
an Angular application

160
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:39,450
by running this module
when the document loads.

161
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:43,570
The modules isn't doing anything
yet, but just by including it,

162
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:47,520
it's going to treat the
HTML inside of this element

163
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,520
as part of the Angular app.

164
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,960
And this means we can
start writing expressions.

165
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,720
Expressions are how we insert
dynamic values into our HTML.

166
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,260
Here's some basic ones just
using numerical operations.

167
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:07,550
So if we say "I am 4 + 6," that's
going to render out on the page

168
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,390
as "I am 10."

169
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,090
We can also do
string operations.

170
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,180
Saying "hello" +
"you" and that's

171
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,160
going to evaluate to "hello
you," as you might expect.

172
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,990
We'll be using lots
of expressions inside

173
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,600
of our Angular application,
but for more examples

174
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,580
check out this URL.

175
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:30,550
So if I move "hello you" into
our Angular application,

176
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,620
and I load it up
locally in my browser,

177
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,820
I'm going to get "hello you,"
just as you might expect.

178
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,250
So we learned about directives,
modules, and expressions.

179
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,150
Why don't you try
putting them all together

180
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,670
in the challenges and I'll
see you in the next section.
