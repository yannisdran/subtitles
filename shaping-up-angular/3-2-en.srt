1
00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:03,420
So we're back
working on our form.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,690
And before we get
any further we need

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,119
to organize our
code a little bit.

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,520
See that review variable?

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,250
We didn't define it anywhere.

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,130
And it's good
practice to define it.

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,200
We can use ng-init, but
like we mentioned before,

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,530
it's better to do initialization
inside a controller.

9
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,070
So let's create a controller
for our review form.

10
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,796
We'll call it ReviewController.

11
00:00:26,796 --> 00:00:28,670
and the only thing we
need to do inside of it

12
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,950
so far is to initialize
a property called review

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,370
and set it equal
to an empty object.

14
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,900
Then on our form we're going to
use the ng-controller directive

15
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:45,360
and attach the review
controller as reviewCtrl.

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,300
Why are we using Ctrl?

17
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,940
Because if you read other
people's Angular code

18
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:55,070
they'll often use that as
an alias, just adding Ctrl.

19
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,900
Now we need to update
all the expressions

20
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,480
to use this controller alias.

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,380
So let's do that.

22
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,070
Perfect.

23
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,660
Now let's make our form actually
submit and do something.

24
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,860
We need a new
directive for that.

25
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,150
In this case, ng-submit.

26
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,800
ng-submit allows us
to call a function

27
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,010
when the form is submitted.

28
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:23,040
So we'll simply specify
ng-submit reviwCtrl.addReview

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,560
and we're going to send
in the current product

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,570
that we're iterating
through, you

31
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,320
know, from our StoreController.

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,900
Next step, we need to
define this function

33
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,450
inside of our ReviewController.

34
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,000
So here's the add
review function.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,590
It takes in product
as a single argument,

36
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,520
then we'll get the
product's current reviews

37
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,230
by calling product.reviews.

38
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:51,410
And we'll push the controller's
review, this.review,

39
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:55,070
on to the reviews array.

40
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,190
Now if we jump
back into the form,

41
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,500
we can go ahead and
submit our review.

42
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,900
You can see it gets added, but
now the form wasn't cleared out

43
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,340
and our live preview
wasn't either.

44
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,210
So it looks like we have
two different reviews.

45
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,520
That's not good.

46
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,150
So how might we
reset the form, which

47
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,030
will clear up the live
preview as well?

48
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,780
So now jumping
back into our code,

49
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,340
inside the addReview
function, we simply

50
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:28,230
need to set this.review equal to
a brand new JavaScript object.

51
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,570
This should properly
clear out the form

52
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,810
and hide that live preview.

53
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,260
Now let's jump into the
form and see what happens.

54
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,530
So now, if we type in
a review, hit Submit,

55
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,230
you can see that the
form gets cleared out,

56
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,890
and we no longer see
duplicate reviews.

57
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,500
Before getting to
the challenges,

58
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,930
you might have noticed
if you're playing along

59
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,190
at home, that we're not
persisting this data.

60
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,320
If you were to refresh the
page after adding a review,

61
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,250
it would get blown away.

62
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,170
We're not saving this to a
server anywhere and that's OK.

63
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,650
We'll get so that
eventually in this course.

64
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,620
But in the meantime,
go practice this stuff.
