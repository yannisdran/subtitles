00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:02,930
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,370
In this section, we're going
to be going over validations

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,040
because every form
needs good validations,

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,030
and Angular comes with some
great built-in ones that you're

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,390
going to want to use.

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,480
To add validations
to our view form,

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,000
the first thing we need
to do is to turn off

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,980
default HTML validations.

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,190
Browsers sometimes
have this built-in,

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,620
and we don't want to do it.

11
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,210
We want to be more consistent.

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,960
So let's run novalidate in
our form tag as an attribute.

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,710
Next, let's mark the fields
that are required for our form

14
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,720
by simply adding the required
attribute, like you see here.

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,530
Lastly, to see if our form
is validating properly,

16
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,790
let's simply add some
debugging code here.

17
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,710
We'll say reviewForm
is reviewForm.$valid,

18
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,730
which will be true or false.

19
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,980
There's some Angular
magic going on here.

20
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,140
First, notice that our form
has a name -- attribute --

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,350
and the name is reviewForm.

22
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,670
That's where we get that
first part of that expression.

23
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:10,640
And then when .$valid, $ means
we're referencing a property

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,660
on the form, and that's a
built-in property from Angular.

25
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,340
We're not having to
define valid anywhere.

26
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,500
It comes with Angular.

27
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,230
Now if we jump
back into our form,

28
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,470
and we fill out all
the fields, you'll

29
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,760
see that valid turns
from false to true,

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,610
as you might expect it to.

31
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,540
There's another cool
thing here going on

32
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,487
where, if we play around
with the email address,

33
00:01:34,487 --> 00:01:36,320
you'll notice that it's
validating that it's

34
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,650
a proper email address.

35
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,990
Kind of neat.

36
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,640
Now, if we have this
invalid email address,

37
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,940
and the form is invalid,
can we submit the form?

38
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,560
Yeah.

39
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,570
We can still submit the form.

40
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,300
We don't want that.

41
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,050
We'll need to prevent that
from getting submitted.

42
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,310
Really, we only
one that addReview

43
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,830
function to be called
if the form is valid.

44
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,370
So using our knowledge of the
reviewForm valid property,

45
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,860
we can put that
inside ng-submit.

46
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,750
So when this form is
submitted, if valid is false,

47
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,390
then addReview will
never get called.

48
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,570
Only if valid is true will the
second part of the expression

49
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,490
be evaluated and
addReview get called.

50
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,780
Now, if we have an invalid form,
and we attempt to submit it,

51
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,770
nothing happens.

52
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,910
Well, that's good,
but we still need

53
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,490
to give the user
some sort of hint

54
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,890
of why their form is invalid.

55
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,640
Well, if we looked
at the HTML that

56
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,060
gets rendered on our
page -- in particular,

57
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,040
the form elements -- we would see
that the input value before we

58
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,840
started typing email has a
class of ng-pristine -- which

59
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,510
means it hasn't been
touched -- and ng-invalid,

60
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,820
which means the
email is not valid.

61
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,430
As we start typing inside
that field, the class changes.

62
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,980
The class gets
updated to ng-dirty,

63
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,420
but it's still invalid.

64
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,030
So it still has ng-invalid.

65
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,602
Then, after we
have a valid email,

66
00:03:13,602 --> 00:03:18,460
that ng-invalid
turns into ng-valid.

67
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,130
All this is default magic
that Angular adds for you.

68
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,880
So with this in mind, let's
highlight these form fields

69
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,500
using classes after
we start typing to see

70
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,990
if a field is valid or invalid.

71
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,470
So let's jump in
and write some CSS.

72
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,770
We can check to see if
it's invalid and dirty,

73
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,030
then we'll use one border
color:  this is red.

74
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,090
And if it's valid and dirty,
we'll change it to green.

75
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,850
You might be wondering why
we use ng-dirty at all.

76
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,490
That's because we don't want
these borders to show up

77
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,670
until they've started typing.

78
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,160
Now if we jump
back into our form,

79
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,510
you can see as we start
typing an email address,

80
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:00,570
it turns red until it's valid,
and then it turns green.

81
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,350
You might also notice the
live preview doesn't render

82
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,670
this value until it's valid.

83
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,900
It's kind of neat.

84
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,610
As you see, Angular has
built-in email validation, a lot

85
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:16,630
like HTML5 form validation.

86
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,444
It also can validate
URLs or even numbers.

87
00:04:20,444 --> 00:04:22,110
And when you have a
number, you can even

88
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,730
specify a minimum and maximum.

89
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,430
Time for you to
try out validation.

90
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,330
And I'll see you in level four.

91
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,890
You're watching Warming
Up with Angular.

92
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,380
Welcome to Warming
Up With Angular.

93
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,930
