00:00:00,206 --> 00:00:01,830
[SINGING] The Flatlanders
 need a store

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,470
to sell their gems and more.

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,510
They need it really quick,
Angular will do the trick.

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,460
Directives set the
stage in your HTML page,

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,310
controllers give your wrap
the behavior that it lacks.

6
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,525
Write expressions so that
you can add your data

7
00:00:14,525 --> 00:00:16,800
to the view and modules
make connections

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,320
with dependency injections.

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,780
You're a scripting
connoisseur when

10
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,540
shaping up with Angular.JS.

11
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,200
You're watching Shaping
Up With Angular.JS. This

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,140
is Level Two where we're going
to be talking about filters,

13
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,120
more directives, and how to
keep your code clean.

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,370
To review some of the
directives we've gone over,

15
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,100
we've got ng-app - that's how
we attach the application

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,670
module to the page.

17
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,520
We have ng-controller - that's
how we attach a controller

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,710
function to the page.

19
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,140
We have ng-show and
ng-hide to display or hide

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,240
a section based
on an expression.

21
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,710
And we have ng-repeat
to repeat a section

22
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,596
for each item in an array.

23
00:01:00,596 --> 00:01:03,590
Now jumping back into
our current example,

24
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,390
we've prettied up
some of our code

25
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,500
to use some Twitter
Bootstrap elements.

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,460
But we're still
doing the same thing,

27
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,300
iterating through
each of our products

28
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,164
and printing it
out to the screen.

29
00:01:13,164 --> 00:01:14,705
If we were to call
us up in a browser

30
00:01:14,705 --> 00:01:17,880
it might look
something like this.

31
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,080
Now you'll notice here that
something doesn't quite

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,880
look right with
our dollar values.

33
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,610
We're simply putting a
dollar sign before the price

34
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,600
and one of our prices
is 2, so it's not

35
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,690
showing the right number
of decimal points.

36
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,000
Luckily, Angular has a better
way to deal with currency.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,280
We can use the currency filter
in our price expression.

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,570
Notice here, between these
two calls we have a pipe.

39
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:49,210
The pipe says take the result
of the first expression

40
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,610
and send the output into
the second expression, which

41
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,300
in this case is a filter.

42
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,040
Currency will print out the
proper dollar sign localized,

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,260
it will also give us the
correct number of decimals.

44
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,920
So now when we call this
page in our browser,

45
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,570
we can see their currency
is properly formatted.

46
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:14,010
Angular has a bunch of filters
and they follow this format

47
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,230
where you take some data and
you pipe that into a filter,

48
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,960
sometimes even
specifying options.

49
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,800
For example, if we
had a timestamp,

50
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,110
we could pipe that into
the date filter specifying

51
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,845
the format of the
date we wanted.

52
00:02:28,845 --> 00:02:33,460
We can also specify a filter
of uppercase or lowercase

53
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,480
on a string.

54
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,300
Next, we have the
limitTo filter which

55
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,600
will allow us to limit
the number of characters

56
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,370
in a string, if we want.

57
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,020
It's also really
useful if we want

58
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,410
to limit the number
of items in an array.

59
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,220
Like if we only want to display
the first three products.

60
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,740
The orderBy by filter will allow us to sort our products.

61
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,870
In this case, if we wanted to sort our products

62
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,910
from most expensive to least expensive,

63
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,530
we would write pipe orderBy minus price.

64
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,300
Without the minus, products would

65
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,545
list in ascending order from cheapest to most expensive.

66
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,040
Each of our products
has a bunch of pictures

67
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,670
that are associated with it.

68
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,540
So we need add that
to our data set.

69
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,220
So here you can see we now
have an images property which

70
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,500
contains a new array.

71
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,440
Inside of that array
there are a series

72
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,080
of image objects,
each of which contains

73
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,960
a full image and
a thumbnail image.

74
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,250
So, to display the first
image of your product,

75
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:43,110
we might write product dot images,
specify the index, dot full.

76
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,540
If we took that and put it as
an expression inside the source

77
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,700
attribute of an image tag,
well, it wouldn't work.

78
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,320
The browser tries
to load the image

79
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,090
before the expression evaluates.

80
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,600
So to print out
this image, we need

81
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,090
to use the ng-source
directive like you see here.

82
00:04:05,437 --> 00:04:07,020
Then if we jump back into our browser,

83
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,860
we can see that all the images are showing properly.

84
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,580
Why don't you try using
some filters and ng-source?

85
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,590
And I'll see you in
the next section.
