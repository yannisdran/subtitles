1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,660
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,810
In this last section we're going
to be talking about services.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,760
One of which will
allow us to get rid

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,750
of this array of data we're
storing right here in our page

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,080
and instead pull it from an API.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,190
So here you might
see a sample URL

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,590
that we might call out
to products.json which

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,084
will return us a JSON array
of all of our products,

9
00:00:26,084 --> 00:00:28,000
which we want to load
in our store controller.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,380
Hm.

11
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,409
So what does that
code look like?

12
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:35,000
As I mentioned,
we need a service.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,940
Angular comes with
a bunch of services

14
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,860
built in which you
can use to give

15
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,250
your controller
additional functionality.

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,110
You could do things
like fetching JSON

17
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,070
from a web service
using the HTTP service.

18
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,040
You can also log out messages
to the JavaScript console

19
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,510
with a log service.

20
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,200
Or you could filter out an
array with the filter service.

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,170
As you might have noticed,
all these services

22
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,660
begin with a dollar sign.

23
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,052
That's because they're built-in
services with Angular.

24
00:01:03,052 --> 00:01:05,150
The HTTP service
is the one we need

25
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,990
to use to get that JSON
data from our server.

26
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,210
We can do this by
using the HTTP method

27
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,030
as a function with an options
object, like you see here,

28
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,950
sending in the
method and the url.

29
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,480
Or we can use one of
the shortcut methods,

30
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,480
using the get method,
sending in a URL,

31
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,160
and any additional
query parameters

32
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,180
by sending in a
JavaScript object.

33
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,420
Both of these methods
return a promise.

34
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,800
And if you're not
familiar with promises,

35
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,270
check out our JQuery
courses on Code School.

36
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,130
A promise object allows
you to call backs on it,

37
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,250
like success or error, which
you'll see in a minute.

38
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,190
One nice feature of
the service is it

39
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,270
if we tell HTTP to
fetch JSON, the result

40
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,480
will automatically be decoded
into JavaScript objects

41
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,570
in arrays.

42
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,150
Pretty nice.

43
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,300
We need our controllers
to tell Angular

44
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,570
which services they need.

45
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:02,070
To do this, we use a
funky array syntax.

46
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,060
First in this array
syntax we specify

47
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,700
the names of the services
that our controller needs.

48
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,450
These services become arguments
in our controller function.

49
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,190
Here we can then use $http
inside the controller.

50
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,270
This way of specifying
the different services

51
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:24,400
our controller needs is
called dependency injection.

52
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,757
And if you needed more
than one service here's

53
00:02:26,757 --> 00:02:27,840
what that might look like.

54
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,420
I know this looks
a little funky,

55
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,890
this dependency injection
thing's a little weird.

56
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,380
So let me see if I can try to
explain what's going on here.

57
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,060
When Angular loads it creates
something called an injector.

58
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,010
When these built-in
services load,

59
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,590
they register with the injector
as being available libraries.

60
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,450
Then when our application loads,
it registers our controller

61
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,070
with the injector, telling
it that when it gets

62
00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:00,230
executed it's going to need
the HTTP and log services.

63
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,930
Injector says, cool.

64
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,240
Then when our page loads,
and our controller gets used,

65
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,450
the injector grabs the
services that our controller

66
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:13,160
needs and passes
them in as arguments.

67
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,240
That's called
dependency injection

68
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,000
because it's injecting the
dependencies-- in this case,

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,960
the services-- into the
controller as arguments.

70
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,620
So here we are back in
our store controller.

71
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,840
And we need that HTTP service.

72
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,750
So, we use that weird
array syntax and we specify

73
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,760
'$http' there as a
service it needs,

74
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,524
and then we specify
$http has an argument.

75
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:49,190
Now we can use it
inside our controller.

76
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,350
So we'll write $http.get
specify the URL to call.

77
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,230
Now we need to tell it what to
do when it gets the data back.

78
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,640
So we'll write .success,
sending a call back to success,

79
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,180
because it's going
to return some data.

80
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,720
And now we need to do
something with that data.

81
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,280
Really, we need to set it
equal to this.products,

82
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,899
but can we write this.products
inside that callback?

83
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,000
No.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,980
Because this inside of that
callback is the service, $http.

85
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,950
So here we need to do
something a little funky.

86
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,960
We're going to create a
variable called store.

87
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,712
Set it equal to this, and
now inside of our callback

88
00:04:36,712 --> 00:04:41,550
we can write
store.products = data.

89
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,350
This request might
take a second,

90
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,520
but our page isn't
going to wait for it.

91
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,870
It's going to go ahead and load.

92
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,170
So it might be a good idea
to initialize products

93
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,570
to an empty array.

94
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,130
That way when the page
loads there's no errors.

95
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,510
Then later on, after
we fetch the JSON,

96
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,080
we can load that data
into the products,

97
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,085
and the page will
automatically get updated.

98
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,800
Here you can see
our page loading

99
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:14,450
and our products getting loaded
dynamically from a remote API.

100
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,230
In addition to get requests,
HTTP can do things like post,

101
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,510
put, and delete.

102
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,380
And here's the syntax for that.

103
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,660
It can also go load
any other HTTP method

104
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,744
by using a config object,
like you see here.

105
00:05:28,744 --> 00:05:30,160
You'll need some
of these commands

106
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,540
in the challenges which I'm
going to set you loose on.

107
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,760
Complete those
challenges and I will

108
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,880
see you in the outro video
at the end of the course.

109
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,140
Thanks for watching.

110
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,220
In the HTTP [NONSENSICAL SOUNDS]

111
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,510
It's over here
[NONSENSICAL SOUNDS]

112
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,960
Cool, I got it!
