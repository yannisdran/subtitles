00:00:00,206 --> 00:00:01,830
[SINGING] The Flatlanders need a store

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,470
to sell their gems and more.

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,510
They need it really quick -
Angular will do the trick.

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,460
Directives set the stage
and your HTML page.

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,310
Controllers give your wrap
the behavior that it lacks.

6
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,340
Write expressions so that you
can add your data to the view.

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,320
And modules make connections
with dependency injections.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:28,095
You're a scripting connoisseur
when Shaping Up with Angular.JS

9
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:29,720
You're watching
Shaping Up with Angular

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,460
and this is Level
Three, where we're

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,550
going to be talking about
creating your own form to add

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,850
new reviews, in our case.

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,970
So here we are
back in our store.

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,450
And you'll notice when
I click on it Reviews,

15
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,180
it lists out all the
different reviews for product.

16
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,740
And I can rate the product.

17
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,820
As I start typing
out the review,

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,220
it gives me a nice
live preview so I

19
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,550
can see what my review
is going to look like.

20
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,460
When I submit it, the
review get solidified

21
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,940
on to the page and
my form gets reset.

22
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,739
Let's figure out how to do this.

23
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:04,280
We haven't dealt
with reviews before.

24
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,790
Here you can see we just added
it to our products array.

25
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,140
So you can see
each product has at

26
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,160
an array of reviews, which
each have properties.

27
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,480
Next, inside of
our reviews panel

28
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,540
we'll simply do another
ng-repeat for review

29
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,110
in product.reviews.

30
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:28,890
So this is another loop inside
of our original product loop.

31
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,830
And inside there we'll
print out the review stars,

32
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,664
review body, and review author.

33
00:01:35,664 --> 00:01:37,080
If we call this
up in our browser,

34
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,050
here's what our reviews
would look like.

35
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,450
Nothing new here that
you haven't seen before.

36
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,870
But how do we start to implement
a form to post a new review?

37
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,770
Without any new Angular elements,
here's the HTML for our form.

38
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,090
We simply have a select
field, a text area,

39
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,210
and if you input elements
so that our form on our page

40
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,920
is going to look
something like this.

41
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,850
Next, let's add our
live preview code.

42
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,700
So here, just like when we
printed out each review,

43
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,550
we're going to block
quote, print out

44
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,040
the stars, the body,
and the author.

45
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,710
Now, we haven't defined
this review variable yet.

46
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,800
Just like in the previous
level, we didn't really

47
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,250
define the tab variable, we
could just start using it.

48
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,310
But now we need a way
to bind each of these

49
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,890
to the proper form element. Hm ...

50
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,240
We do this using the
ng-model directive.

51
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,130
So we can see
ng-model review.stars,

52
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,660
which will bind to
this form element

53
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,770
to the review.stars
stars value in our page.

54
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,260
Here we're going to see more
of that Angular magic is

55
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,470
that 2-way Binding.

56
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,730
So if we jump back
into the page,

57
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,990
we're going to see that
as we update the form,

58
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,220
the live preview
automatically gets

59
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,355
updated for each
of these fields.

60
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,280
Obviously, our form
isn't going to work yet,

61
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,910
we haven't told it what to
do when it gets submitted.

62
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,590
But before we do
that, I want to let

63
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,180
you know about two
more binding examples.

64
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,260
First, if you have
a checkbox, we

65
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,430
could use ng-model to bind
to the checkbox, which

66
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,860
we'll set it to true or false.

67
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,200
Also with radio buttons
we could set ng-model.

68
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,250
In this case, of
course, the value

69
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,990
would be red, blue, or green
 - based on which is selected.

70
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,590
Before we move any
further, I want

71
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,090
to make sure you're
comfortable with using ng-model

72
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,560
to create forms.

73
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,970
Give it a try and then
we'll take the next step.
