1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,830
Now, let's add some
more interactivity

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,780
to our application
by adding some tabs.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,860
As you can see,
each of our products

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,950
has a description,
specification, and reviews tab.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,340
Twitter Bootstrap
comes with some classes,

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,020
which make it pretty
easy to construct

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,460
some tabs, like you see here.

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,570
But how do we add
behavior to these tabs

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,790
so that when we select
one, it becomes active

11
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,650
and the content gets
displayed in the page?

12
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:38,540
One way to do this in Angular is
by using the ng-click directive

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,680
which takes an
expression to evaluate.

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,330
So here we're
saying tab equals 1

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,050
- when we click on
the first one, tab

16
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,290
equals 2 when we
click on the second,

17
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,440
and tab equals 3 when
we click on the third.

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,920
If we want to print out
this value to the page,

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,670
we can simply write
tab as an expression.

20
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,280
Let's see what this
is going to do.

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,850
So if we jump into
the browser, we

22
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,940
can see that if we click
on the different tabs,

23
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,920
the tab value gets
printed out to the screen.

24
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,000
Pretty neat, huh?

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,990
We never defined tab.

26
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,300
But just by clicking on
those different tabs,

27
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,900
it changes the value.

28
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,920
We're starting to get
into the magic of Angular.

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,410
When we click on one
of those tab items,

30
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,100
the tab expression
automatically gets updated.

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,940
See, expressions like this
define a 2-way Data Binding.

32
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,940
A 2-way way Data Binding.

33
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,740
This means that expressions
are re-evaluated when

34
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,970
the property changes.

35
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,680
So that expression
is keeping an eye

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,030
out for when that
value of tab changes

37
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:50,290
and if it does get changed, it
gets updated in the web page.

38
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,380
Now that we have the tab
navigation figured out,

39
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,110
we need to create
the tab panels.

40
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,910
You know, where the
content for the tab goes.

41
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,540
So let's flesh that out
as you can see here.

42
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,220
Content in each of them.

43
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,500
But how do we get the proper panel

44
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:10,050
to show up when we click on that corresponding tab navigation?

45
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,960
Well, we need to
use ng-show again.

46
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,280
We can say ng-show and this
time pass in an expression.

47
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,030
When tab is equal to
1, display this one.

48
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,790
When tabs equal to 2, show this
one, and when tab's equal to 3,

49
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,700
show that one.

50
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,440
Now when a tab is selected it's
going to show the proper panel.

51
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,810
Here we are back in our browser.

52
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,010
And you'll see when
we click on a tab it

53
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,050
shows the proper panel.

54
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,180
But when we refresh the
page none of the panels

55
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,590
are showing up.

56
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,310
It would be good to set
an initial value for tab.

57
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,650
How do we do that?

58
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,920
The ng-init directive
allows us to evaluate

59
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,190
an expression in
the current scope.

60
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:02,360
So here we're going to write
ng-init equals tab equals

61
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,360
1, which is going to initialize
the value of tab to 1.

62
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,070
So if we jump back
into the browser,

63
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,260
we can see that tab
is initialized to 1

64
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,920
and the description
panel is shown.

65
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,200
But wouldn't it be nice to
show which tab is active?

66
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,750
And in fact,
bootstrap has classes

67
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,890
so that the right
tab gets highlighted.

68
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,310
How might we detect
which tab is active

69
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,620
and then add a class
to the appropriate tab?

70
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,810
To do this, big surprise, we
need to use a new directive.

71
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,690
The ng-class directive, which
takes a bunch of arguments,

72
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,640
but we're going to
send in an object.

73
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,020
In this object we're
going to specify,

74
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:52,290
as a key, the name of
the class we want to set.

75
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,320
And then as a value, an
expression to evaluate.

76
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,800
If this expression
is true, we'll

77
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,370
append this class
to the element.

78
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,840
And if it's not, we're not.

79
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,570
In our case, we're
going to check

80
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:10,650
to see if the tab is equal to 1.

81
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,970
And if it is we'll set
the class to active.

82
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:19,250
And then, of course, 2
and 3 for the other tabs.

83
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,600
Then back in our browser you
can see that our tabs are now

84
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,670
using the active class properly.

85
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,810
Much nicer.

86
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,290
If it's starting to
feel a little bit

87
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,700
dirty, a little bit of
a wrong, that you're

88
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,500
putting all this logic
inside your HTML page,

89
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,350
well, you're kind of right.

90
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,510
We need to figure out how to
pull that logic into something

91
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,200
to organize it.

92
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,840
The best place here
might be a controller.

93
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,870
Not our store controller,
we need a new controller

94
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,000
for this logic.

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,340
Maybe we'll call it
our panel controller.

96
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,090
First we'll use the
ng-controller directive,

97
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:06,380
specifying our PanelController as panel.

98
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,650
Panel is our alias that we'll
be using inside of this element

99
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,910
to refer to our
PanelController.

100
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,330
Then our app.js will define
our PanelController.

101
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,970
Our next step is to move
the tab initialization

102
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,080
inside of our PanelController.

103
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,020
ng-init is great
for prototyping,

104
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,000
but really initialization and configuration

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,330
should go inside of a controller.

106
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,730
In this case, we'll make tab a property of our controller.

107
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,110
So we'll be able to refer to it as panel dot tab.

108
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,060
Next, let's take the assignment
logic out of our HTML

109
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,480
and create a function expression.

110
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,030
This is going to take a parameter - setTab -

111
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,670
and inside this function we'll set

112
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,740
the tab property equal to that variable.

113
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,680
And then inside of our ng-click expression,

114
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,470
we'll simply call panel.selectTab(1),

115
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,400
panel.selectTab(2), and panel.selectTab(3).

116
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,460
Lastly, let's create a function for our comparison.

117
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,937
We'll call it "isSelected."

118
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,770
Now we'll check to see if the current tab is

119
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,520
equal to this tab to check and return the value.

120
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,450
This will be either true or false.

121
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,010
And notice here that we're calling

122
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:24,430
isSelected both inside the ng-class directive

123
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,650
and in the panels to detect which one is selected.

124
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,400
Now if we jump back over into the browser

125
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,090
and select the different tabs, we

126
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,530
can see that the behavior hasn't changed.

127
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,930
Everything still works, but
our code is a little cleaner.

128
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,240
It's challenge time.

129
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,320
So why don't you shape up
with some Angular and I'll

130
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,820
see you in Level Three?

131
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,250
Welcome back.

132
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,900
[MUMBLING]

133
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,886
Prettied out.

134
00:06:52,886 --> 00:06:54,930
Prettied out?
