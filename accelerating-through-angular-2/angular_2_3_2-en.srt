1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:02,870
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,450
In section 2 we'll
be talking all

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,820
about component HTML and CSS.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,410
So back inside of our
component we put HTML here,

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:17,916
but how might we tie
CSS into our component?

6
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:22,060
Turns out we can add a
styles array to our metadata.

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,930
So here in our HTML
template, first,

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,400
let's add some new CSS classes.

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,650
And then here you'll
see we specified styles.

10
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,530
Sent an array.

11
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,720
Notice the back tick and
then we have a couple styles.

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,910
If you load up our
web page we could see

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,130
the styles are getting applied.

14
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,060
Our description is smaller
and the price is bold.

15
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,640
If we look at the HTML
source for this code,

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,780
we'd see something
really interesting.

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,070
First of all, in
the HTML, you'll

18
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,670
see that a custom
attribute is getting added

19
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,000
by angular ngcontent-dcy-2.

20
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,519
And then, inside of our CSS you
would see that that same custom

21
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,270
attribute is getting
added to our CSS source

22
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:16,420
effectively scoping our
CSS to our template.

23
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,690
Kind of like properties are
scoped, it's scoping our CSS.

24
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,710
So technically, if I
had a description class

25
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,000
in one component and
a description class

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,260
in another component, they
wouldn't clash with each other

27
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,610
because they're getting scoped.

28
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,590
Mind blown, right?

29
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,080
Because the component
property is scoped

30
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,741
and also the CSS is getting
scoped all to the directive.

31
00:01:45,741 --> 00:01:48,717
PWOO!

32
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:50,550
I don't know, I thought
that was pretty cool

33
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,800
when I was learning Angular 2.

34
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,702
It's time to split things
out into more files.

35
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:59,160
And if you're like me, you're
probably looking at this code

36
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,740
and going, what is
your HTML and CSS doing

37
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,880
inside of my JavaScript?

38
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,020
We need to split this
out into multiple files.

39
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,330
So let's create a
car-parts.component.html where

40
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,820
our HTML will live.

41
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:18,910
And our car-parts.component.css
where our CSS will live.

42
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,660
So back in our component
let's split out this code.

43
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,437
And as you can see here, we have
our car-parts.component.html

44
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,150
and our car-parts.component.css.

45
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,800
Then inside of our
car-parts component

46
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,510
itself, we need to tell
it about these files.

47
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,510
So we write
templateUrl and specify

48
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,030
where I can find this file.

49
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,130
And also we write styleUrls--
this is still an array--

50
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,280
and specify our CSS file.

51
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,530
Even though our CSS is
now in a separate file,

52
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,070
it still gets scoped
to this component.

53
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,080
So what did we learn?

54
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,460
Well, our CSS can be included
inside of our template just

55
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,855
like our HTML.

56
00:02:59,855 --> 00:03:03,510
Our CSS automatically gets
scoped to our component.

57
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,570
PWOO!

58
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,310
And also, our HTML and
CSS can get split out

59
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,470
into their own files to
keep things more organized.

60
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,560
Now as you can see, this is
what our architecture currently

61
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,130
looks like.

62
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,939
And, oh, it's time for you.

63
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:20,730
Do some challenges.

64
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,680
We'll be back in section 3.
