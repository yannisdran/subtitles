1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,510
(SINGING) Cheerio, pip pip,
let's code some Python files.

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,109
We'll use quick lists, and
loop with fors and whiles.

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:12,250
Use modules we can, with
functions write them on.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:18,040
Come join the Spam Van,
fly through Python.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,630
Welcome back to
Flying through Python.

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:29,890
This is level four, covering
reading and writing to files.

7
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,470
The Spam Van has become
wildly successful,

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,940
and is trying to improve its
business with daily sales

9
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,220
reports.

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,510
But to do this, we'll need
more permanent storage.

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,080
You see, if we add each
individual sale to a list,

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,080
the lifetime of that
list is only while we

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,280
are running the program.

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,750
If we quit the program and run
it again, our list isn't saved.

15
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,090
So at the end of
the day, we want

16
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,360
to be able to store these
sales more permanently.

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,780
We can do that in several ways--
with more complex applications

18
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,570
you can use a database,
but here we'll

19
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,870
look at writing data to a
file, and reading from a file.

20
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,430
To write to a file,
first we open the file.

21
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,170
We use the open function with
the file name and the mode.

22
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,360
Here it's W for write.

23
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,840
After we open the file, we
went to save the open file

24
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,300
to a variable.

25
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,380
Here it's sales log.

26
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,810
Second we'll write to the file.

27
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,210
Using saleslog.write,
we'll write

28
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:44,040
the string in parentheses.

29
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,010
Finally, we'll close the
file with saleslog.close.

30
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,100
Here we would have
our resulting file

31
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,320
with our strings written to it.

32
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,660
If the file doesn't exist
for a right or an append,

33
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,980
Python will create it for us.

34
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,590
And also notice that
unlike print, we'll

35
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,770
need to add our own
new line characters.

36
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,759
If we add the new line
character at the end

37
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,560
of our first write
statement, then our strings

38
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,255
are written to separate lines.

39
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,810
After we get a
customer's order, it

40
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,090
would be great if we could
write it to a sales.txt file,

41
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,410
like the one shown here.

42
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,750
Let's assume each
customer's order

43
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,470
is stored as a dictionary of
menu items and their prices.

44
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,530
So we're going to
write each item

45
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,250
and price on a separate line,
and then the order's total.

46
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,330
We'll write our own
function, write sales

47
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,700
log, that takes in
the orders dictionary.

48
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:57,330
In this function we'll open
the file in mode W for write,

49
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,810
then we'll write the order and
the order's total to the file,

50
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,195
and after we're done writing,
we'll close the file.

51
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,830
To write out each
order, we'll loop over

52
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,570
each menu item in
the order dictionary,

53
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,180
and write that item to the file.

54
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,710
If we look at the result we
only have the menu item name,

55
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,890
but we also need the price.

56
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:26,650
So we actually have to loop over
order.items to get the key end

57
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,840
value from the dictionary,
which here is the menu item

58
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,140
name and the price.

59
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:41,540
We'll do for item
price in order.items,

60
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,640
so that we can access the
menu item and its price.

61
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:52,280
And inside the for loop, we'll
write the item with its price.

62
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,380
And our resulting sales
log file is coming along,

63
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,010
but we'll also want
the total in there.

64
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,480
So we'll create a variable
to add the total to,

65
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,960
and for each order we'll
add the item's price

66
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,050
to the total inside
of the for loop.

67
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,260
Then after we've written
each individual order,

68
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,240
we can write the total.

69
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,230
That looks good.

70
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,890
Now let's see what
happens when we

71
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,600
call this function twice for
two different customer orders.

72
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,760
When we do that, we
actually overwrite the file

73
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,360
with the new customer's order,
which is not what we wanted.

74
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,880
This is because we had the
mode set to W for write,

75
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,010
which overrides the file.

76
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,370
Instead we can
change the mode to A

77
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,660
for append, which
will add the new order

78
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,920
to the end of the file.

79
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,300
Now that our new
order is appended

80
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,110
to the end of the file, we
can also add another new line

81
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,830
to separate the orders better.

82
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,400
Great.

83
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,020
Now our sales log is
looking and working right,

84
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,070
and it's time for you
to practice writing

85
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,110
to files in the challenges.

86
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,960
Good luck.
