1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,302
[SINGING] Put down your brains
and your entrails.

2
00:00:03,302 --> 00:00:06,266
It's time to stop
and learn some Rails,

3
00:00:06,266 --> 00:00:09,230
‘cause we got
something new to grab -

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,385
it’s Rails for Zombies by Envy Labs.

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,370
I'm Gregg Pollack, and you're
watching Rails for Zombies.

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,790
This is Level 1,
where we're going

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,530
to be getting
"Deep in the CRUD."

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,175
If you're not yet familiar with
the Ruby programming language,

9
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:27,550
you might want to
pause the video

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,819
and head over to TryRuby.org.

11
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:31,860
Spend a few minutes there
on the tutorial getting

12
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,680
familiar with the
Ruby syntax - you

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,350
don't have to finish
the whole thing -

14
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,330
and then come back over here
and continue this tutorial.

15
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,650
In this tutorial, we're going
to be building a web application

16
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,040
somewhat like
Twitter except it's

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,356
going to be Twitter for zombies.

18
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,790
To start building
our web application,

19
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,620
we're going to start
in the database

20
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,570
with a database
table called tweets.

21
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,010
You might say that
that looks kind

22
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,930
of like an Excel spreadsheet.

23
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:08,250
We've got four rows and we have
three columns across the top.

24
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,480
If we were to name these
columns, the first one we might

25
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:17,090
call id, the second one we
might call status - that's

26
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,420
our tweet - and the
third, we'll call zombie,

27
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,280
meaning the zombie
that posted that tweet.

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,860
The first problem we need to
solve in our web application

29
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:32,760
is how to retrieve the tweet
object with the id equal to 3

30
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,610
so maybe we can display
it on the page later.

31
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,240
Before we try to
solve this challenge,

32
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,030
we need to make sure we all
understand what a hash is.

33
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,400
You might remember
this from Try Ruby.

34
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,840
It's just basically
multiple keys and values

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,950
surrounded by curly braces.

36
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,260
Here you can see row number
3 expressed as a hash.

37
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,080
If we only had a
single key and value,

38
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,290
it might look
something like this.

39
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,990
And a hash recipe you might
say looks something like this.

40
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,870
And as we go
through this course,

41
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,970
you're going to be seeing a
couple different recipes when

42
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:15,420
we want to show you what the
underlying syntax looks like.

43
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,060
The anatomy of a hash
has keys and values.

44
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,790
So id, status, and
zombie are all keys,

45
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,730
and the values
here are 3, "I just

46
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,080
ate some delicious
brains," and "Jim."

47
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,800
The second two are strings.

48
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,440
The first is
obviously an integer.

49
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,140
And we call these keys
symbols - Ruby symbols -

50
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,430
because they have that
colon in front of them.

51
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,340
So we're storing a new hash
inside that b variable,

52
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,490
but how do we read
values out of a hash?

53
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,800
We can do that by
simply specifying

54
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,170
b and sending in
the key, status.

55
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,540
This returns, "I just ate
some delicious brains."

56
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,680
Here's how we would get
the zombie returning "Jim."

57
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,650
We could also
collect multiple keys

58
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,770
and concatenate them together
into a string getting "Jim said,

59
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,900
'I just ate some
delicious brains.'"

60
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,505
Here's a recipe for reading
values out of a hash.

61
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,090
Back to our zombie
challenge where

62
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,770
we want to return the
tweet with the id equals 3.

63
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,820
We kind of want the
results of whatever code

64
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,760
we're about to write to return
something like this hash,

65
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,690
so we can read out
the values from it.

66
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,250
And the code needed to solve
this challenge looks something

67
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,895
like this: t equals
tweet.find(3).

68
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,080
This is going to
return something

69
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,560
that we can then print
out to the screen.

70
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,100
In a Rails application,
when we use the word tweet

71
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:54,100
and it's singular
and uppercase, it's

72
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,670
going to allow us to
access in our database

73
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:04,170
the lowercase and pluralized
table mate, tweets.

74
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,210
When we call find(3),
we're calling a method

75
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,150
on the tweet which
is going to fetch

76
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,790
the tweet with the id of 3 and
store it in that t variable.

77
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:20,360
So now if we do puts t id,
we get back the id of 3.

78
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,210
If we do puts t status, we get
back, "I just ate some delicious

79
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,770
brains," and if we
do puts t zombie,

80
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,762
we get back "Jim," as
you might expect.

81
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:34,320
When we're getting
values at the database,

82
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,890
we don't use a hash syntax.

83
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,480
We use a dot syntax.

84
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:45,040
We typically just say
t.id, t.status, or t.zombie

85
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,270
and it returns the same thing.

86
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,070
You see that symbol up there.

87
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,370
It's actually going to be
our symbol in this tutorial

88
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,820
for alternate syntax,
and it happens

89
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,770
to be the international
symbol for Rubber Man as well.

90
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,970
I just made that up right now.

91
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,950
It looks like a
student has a question.

92
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:07,020
Well, should we use the hash
syntax or the dot syntax?

93
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,890
Well in most Rails
applications, you'll

94
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:13,530
see people using the dot syntax,
so let's just do that from now

95
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,650
on.

96
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,370
Let's say we had a weapons
table in our database

97
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,520
and we wanted to
get the weapon out

98
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,920
of the database
with the id of 1.

99
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,130
Well, based on what
we know so far,

100
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,790
we might write w
equals weapon find(1).

101
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,540
Now that w is just
the variable name,

102
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,370
and we could have called
the variable anything,

103
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,610
but that would go
into our weapons table

104
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,460
and pull back our weapon
which we could then

105
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,904
print out to the screen.

106
00:05:43,904 --> 00:05:45,570
You might be wondering
why this level is

107
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,300
called "Deep in the CRUD."

108
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,940
Well, CRUD, in case
you're not familiar,

109
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,130
stands for Create, Read,
Update, and Delete.

110
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,500
It's a database thing.

111
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,430
So we're going to figure out how
to do each of these things now.

112
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,690
And, well, we already
figured out how to read.

113
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,760
We can just call tweet.find(3).

114
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,150
How might we create
a tweet though?

115
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,720
To do this, we can call
t equals tweet.new.

116
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,240
That's going to create
a new tweet for us.

117
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,260
We can set some values,
like the status,

118
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,060
and then by calling the
save method on our tweet,

119
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,760
it will save it to the database.

120
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,500
To update the
tweet, we can first

121
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,680
fetch it from the database,
then update a value,

122
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,510
and then save it, and
Rails will automatically

123
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,425
update our database record.

124
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:35,060
To delete a tweet, we
can find an existing one

125
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,600
and then simply call t.destroy.

126
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,190
Let's go through all
of our CRUD statements

127
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,490
now one at a time starting
with creating a zombie.

128
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,100
You might notice
here that we don't

129
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,780
have to set a new id
on this new tweet.

130
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,441
That's because Rails
takes care of this for us.

131
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:55,690
The recipe here, which you
could use for other tables,

132
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,890
look something like this.

133
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,890
Notice that every
word in the table name

134
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,140
is going to be capitalized.

135
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,540
There's two alternate syntaxes
here you should be aware of.

136
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,450
The first is that we
can send in a hash

137
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,750
into tweet.new with a
series of keys and values

138
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,500
which will get set
on our new tweet.

139
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,020
Then we can simply save it.

140
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,080
Here's the recipe for that.

141
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,560
Lastly if we call tweet.create
and send in a hash,

142
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,030
it will actually create
a new tweet for us

143
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,640
and automatically save
it to the database.

144
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,160
And here's the recipe for that.

145
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,630
Next let's go on to read.

146
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,050
And we saw how to call the
find method, sends in an id,

147
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,250
and that returns a single
tweet with the id of 2.

148
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:46,880
However, we can also send in
multiple parameters specifying

149
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,390
multiple ids and that will
return an array of tweets

150
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,865
with these ids.

151
00:07:51,865 --> 00:07:54,970
We can call Tweet.first.

152
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,020
That's going to return
the first tweet.

153
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,630
We can also call Tweet.last
to return the last week.

154
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,950
And finally, we
can call Tweet.all,

155
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:07,630
which will return an array
with all of the tweets.

156
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,690
A few more reading functions
starting with count.

157
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,500
Count is actually going to run
a count query on our database

158
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,520
and return for us the
total number of tweets.

159
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,320
We can also specify
the order of tweets

160
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,285
we want returned - in this case,
order them by the zombie name.

161
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:26,660
We can limit the
number of tweets

162
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,190
we return - in this case, 10.

163
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,920
We can also return
all tweets where

164
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,500
zombie name is equal to ash.

165
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,179
Here's where Rail starts
to get really powerful.

166
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,090
You see many of these methods
can be chained together

167
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,380
to create a complex query.

168
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,210
Let me show you what I mean.

169
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:50,130
Here is a query which
uses method chaining.

170
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,910
Let's take a closer look.

171
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:55,330
This is going to return only
tweets from the zombie whose

172
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,180
name is Ash, it's
going to be ordered

173
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,150
by the status of the
tweet, and it's only

174
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:05,490
going to return the
first 10 of these tweets.

175
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,070
As we saw in the previous
slide, when we call tweet

176
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,560
where zombie Ash, it's
going to return an array.

177
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,330
Even if there's only one
tweet from zombie Ash,

178
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,150
it's still going
to return an array.

179
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:22,680
But we only may want the first
tweet from zombie Ash in which

180
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:29,360
case we can call .first just
giving us the first one.

181
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,920
Here's the code we need
to update a zombie,

182
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,670
and here's the recipe
that goes along

183
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,380
with this - shouldn't
be surprising.

184
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,390
There's an alternate
syntax here though.

185
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,850
We can also set multiple
attributes on this tweet

186
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,870
by simply saying attributes
equals and sending in a hash.

187
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,800
Here's the recipe for that.

188
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,580
We can simplify this further by
using the update method, which

189
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,640
allows us to send in
a hash of attributes

190
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,590
we want to have updated,
and this code automatically

191
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,750
saves these values
to the database.

192
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:07,130
Here's the recipe for
that - pretty simple.

193
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,620
Here's our code for deleting
a zombie and the recipe that

194
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,500
goes along with it.

195
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,160
As you might suspect, we can
do all of this in one line,

196
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,580
finding and destroying the
zombie-- pretty simple.

197
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,579
If we ever wanted to
delete all of the tweets,

198
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,120
we could also call
tweet.destroy_all.

199
00:10:27,302 --> 00:10:29,730
Now if you're a software
developer by trade,

200
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,370
you probably suspect that
I'm leaving out some details

201
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,170
about how all this stuff
get stitched together,

202
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,300
but don't worry.

203
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,040
We're going to get into
that in the next level.

204
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,250
In the meantime, go
do some challenges

205
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,520
and get familiar
with this syntax.

206
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,940
And I'll see you
in the next level.
